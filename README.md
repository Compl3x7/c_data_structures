# c_data_structures

In this repository I implement some data structures libraries in C. Due to the C language limitations (a.k.a. my own skill issues :skull:) most of the implementations, if not all, only support the double C type. Most of this code isn't really of much use but feel free to do so and please let me know if you did :D.

## Data structures implemented until now:

### my_list (Finished ~2023's summer)

A simple implementation of a linked list that I built prior to the making of this repository as a way to study and better consolidate my C programming skills. It's probably not even a good implementation, but I have decided to left it like this for now. Finished around 2023's summer and haven't touched on it ever since.

- 24/04/2024
    - Changed some function names, added list_find() function and changed the name to my_list.

### my_vector (On going...)

A vector (redimensionable array) implementation.

- 24/04/2024
    - Started implementing, implemented constructor and destructor.

    - Implemented some base functionality like printing to console, basic addition and removal of elements with resizing, and some "query" functions.

- 28/04/2024
    - Implemented some more addition and removal functionality.

- 30/04/2024
    - Improved error handling and refactored vector members types to be size_t.

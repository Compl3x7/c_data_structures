# c_data_structures

In this repository I implement some data structures libraries in C, due to the C language limitations (a.k.a. skill issues :skull:), most of the implementations, if not all, only support the double C type.

## Data structures implemented until now:

### my_list (Finished ~2023's summer)

A simple implementation of a linked list that I built prior to the making of this repository as a way to study and better consolidate my C programming skills. It's probably not the best implementation, but I have decided to left it like this. Finished around 2023's summer and haven't touched on it ever since.

    - Changed some function names and added list_find() function and changed the name to my_list.
